atm-lab project

The atm code creates the ATM, but the methods in the Bank and BankAccount 
classes which actually do the banking functions are incomplete.
The lab class exercise (with tutor support) is to complete the BankAccount.

There are four places in the code you need to change:
-   in the Bank class, the login method needs code to find a bank account, 
    given a username and password
-   in the BankAccount class, the three methods withdraw, deposit and balance
    need code added to make them work properly.

Everyone hates Vlad.
